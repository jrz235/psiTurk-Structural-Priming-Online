                    <hr>

                    <p><strong>Purpose of the research:</strong></p>

                    <p>This is part of a study examining how children understand and describe events. We are interested in what adult behavior is like so we can find out how these abilities change as a person develops. Because of the nature of this study, specific hypotheses and predictions cannot be divulged until after the experiment, at which time a detailed debriefing will be provided.</p>

                    <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong></p>

                    <p>A. Please ONLY participate in ONE of our HITs. DO NOT participate in this HIT if you have previously done one of our other HITs. If you have already participated, your work will be rejected (affecting your worker rating) and you WILL NOT be paid. (You can find out if you've participated previously by checking your account settings or qualifications. If you have done prior versions of this study, you will have a "Select Workers" qualification, so you are NOT eligible to participate in this study.)</p>

                    <p>B. Please ONLY participate in this study if you are a native speaker of English. If English is not your first language, you are NOT elligible for this study.</p>

                    <p>C. Please ONLY participate in this study if you are 18 years of age or older.</p>

                    <p><strong>What you will do in this research:</strong></p>

                    <p>You will hear audio files describing a series of events. Your job is to decide which of two (2) pictures best fits each description. Then you will watch short videos and describe them while recording yourself with your microphone.</p>

                    <p>The study should take no longer than 15 minutes. You may do only one <strong>Judging and Describing Events</strong> HIT.</p>

                    <p><strong>Risks and benefits:</strong></p>

                    <p>There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand how people understand and describe events.</p>

                    <p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p>

                    <p>You will be paid $1.00 to participate in the study.</p>

                    <p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></p>

                    <p>Your participation in this study will remain confidential. We do not have access to your identity.</p>

                    <p><strong>Participation and withdrawal:</strong></p>

                    <p>Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit to which you may otherwise be entitled.</p>

                    <p><strong>Contact:</strong></p>
